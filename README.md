# Developer Diary of Ben Hoath
I'm a digital designer, and I love thinking up tools and apps to make my life easier and more productive. But thinking isn't enough to bring them to life. I have to build them too!
So this is a repo of my video diary entries about my journey through front-end development with designer roots, solving problems that I hope someone, somewhere has in common with me :D
